My entry to ICICI Appathon '16

A microsavings App (Hybrid, based in Ionic), sort of like a tiny version of the Digit savings App

APIs used (Retail Banking):

    Transactions History
    
    Fund Transfer
    
    Balance
    
    User Account Summary

Features:

    Graphs for visualization of savings progress
    
    Smart Regression-based recommendation engine which analyzes transaction history and detects patterns in spending to recommend optimal amount of money to be saved next time. The regression model hasn't been uploaded to github 'cuz proprietary duh!
    
    Automatic periodic saving, no manual intervention required.
    
    Fire-and-forget type app: install->set configurations->start service->never open app again!

**Outcome**: Didn't make it past Phase #2. 

Secretly wished the judges' foot got stuck in a puddle behind an elephant who is about to fart after a stale egg meal.
